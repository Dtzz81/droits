Dear ((full name)),

During a review of the open droits on our database, I note that the above-referenced droit was for munitions which were destroyed at the time of recovery by EOD. As such, please consider this droit to now be officially closed with no title to pass.

((item pluralised)) as listed and described by you:
((items))

The Receiver of Wreck's responsibility for ((this pluralised)) ((item pluralised)) is now discharged and report reference ((reference)) ((BMAPA ref??COMPANY_####) is now officially closed.

Please keep this email for your files as it is your proof of the resolution of this droit.
Please also note that although on this occasion the item has been destroyed, ((Dredge Company??Enter Dredge Company's name)) is still required to report all future recoveries from dredging activities.

Yours sincerely,
